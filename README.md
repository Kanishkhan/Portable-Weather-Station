A real-time weather monitoring system built using Embedded C on the STM32F4.
It reads data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), LDR (light intensity), and rain sensors, processes them using ADC + SysTick timing, and displays results on an I2C LCD via the PCF8574 module.

The system also provides UART data logs and triggers LED/Buzzer alerts based on weather conditions—demonstrating strong skills in bare-metal programming, sensor interfacing, timing control, and embedded system design.
